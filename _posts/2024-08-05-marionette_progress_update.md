## Marionette Progress Update 1

Recently I have been on a bit of a hiatus from this progress to take some time to work on other projects and hobbies.

Some of the highlights in terms of progress can be seen below:
- Lua lexing for text-editor widget.
- Reorganized lexing data for the text-editor widget.

Some notable things that need to be improved:
- Currently the lua lexer is unable to handle multiline strings.
- The lexer is unable to handle multiline comments.

I am currently working on fixing these issues and will provide an update once they are resolved, not only that but I am also working on a few side-project libraries to demonstrate my proficiency in other languages.
