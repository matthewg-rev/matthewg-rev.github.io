Hello welcome to my blog that I am starting. So I might as well tell you a little about myself. 

I am an incoming 3rd year college student studying Computer Science. 

I have been practicing coding and reverse-engineering since I was eleven years old.

Reverse-engineering is a subject I am really passionate about.
